            api/ (The Brain)-->
What it is: This folder holds your backend server code (Node.js/TypeScript). It's the "brain" of your operation.
Its Job:    Its primary job is to be an API (Application Programming Interface).
            It receives requests from the frontend (like "log this user in" or "get all sites to monitor"),
            processes them, and talks to the database to fetch or save data.

            frontend/ (The Face)
What it is: This folder holds all your user interface code (React). This is the "face" of your application—it's the only part the user actually sees and interacts with in their browser.
Its Job:    It creates the visual dashboard, charts, and forms.
            When a user clicks a button, the code in this folder sends
             a request to your api folder to get information or make a change.

            worker/ (The Laborer)
What it is: This is a background service (also Node.js/TypeScript).
            It's a "laborer" that does a repetitive job without interfering with the api or frontend.
Its Job:    For your project, this worker's only job is to run on a schedule (e.g., every minute), 
            fetch the list of websites from the database, "ping" them all, 
            and then save the results (like "up" or "down" and the response time) back to the database.

            docker-compose.yml (The Blueprint)
What it is: This is your master configuration file for Docker. It's the "blueprint" for your entire application.

Its Job:    It tells Docker exactly how to build and run all your services
            (api, frontend, worker, and your mongo database) as containers.
            Most importantly, it connects them all on a private virtual network so they can find and talk to each other.

            .env (The Secret Keystore)
What it is:  A file to store your environment variables. This is your "secret keystore."

Its Job:     It holds all your sensitive data, like your database password,
             API keys, or any other private information. Your code reads from this file, 
             but you must never share this file or commit it to GitHub. 
             This keeps your secrets safe and out of your source code.
             The tsconfig.json File

             
   The tsconfig.json File
🤔 Why you created it:
This file is the "rulebook" for the TypeScript compiler.

You are writing your code in TypeScript (.ts),
 but browsers and Node.js can only run JavaScript (.js). 
 This file tells the TypeScript compiler (a tool called tsc) exactly how to translate your .ts code into .js code.


  The Dockerfile File
🤔 Why you created it:
This file is the "recipe" or "instruction manual" for Docker.

Its job is to tell Docker, step-by-step, 
how to build a self-contained package (called an "image") of your API. 
This image contains everything your API needs to run: a lightweight operating system (Alpine Linux),
 the Node.js runtime, your code, and all its npm packages.

This is what lets you run your app identically on your machine, a co-worker's machine, or a cloud server.

(Note: The formatting was a bit off in your paste, so I've fixed it. Dockerfile commands are one per line.)
